Massachusetts health officials this week announced 4 new human cases of West Nile virus, bringing the state's total this year [2020] to 7.

Officials said that 3 males and one female were infected. A male in his 40s, one in his 60s, and one in his 80s were all exposed to the virus in Middlesex County. The 4th case was reported in a female under the age of 19. She was exposed in Bristol County, per a news release from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Their conditions were not made clear.

West Nile virus -- which was 1st reported in the U.S. in 1999 -- is typically spread by infected mosquitoes. Though side effects can be severe, most people who are infected experience little to no symptoms and fully recover.

A small percentage of people infected with West Nile virus -- roughly 1 in 5 -- develop a fever and may additionally experience headaches, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash, among other side effects. Even rarer, about 1 in 150 people who are infected with the mosquito-linked ailment can develop a serious illness, such as inflammation of the spinal cord or brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/].

The Mayo Clinic warns that people who are older, as well as those with pre-existing medical conditions, are more susceptible to the virus.

Wearing insect repellent and protective clothing, as well as draining standing water around gardens and homes where mosquitoes can lay eggs, can be helpful in reducing the risk of sustaining a mosquito bite, ultimately mitigating the risk of developing West Nile virus.

This year [2020], the Bay State has reported 7 human cases of West Nile virus. In 2019, the state saw 5.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is now established in the contiguous 48 states of the USA, and cases can be expected in any of them, including Massachusetts, during the transmission season. So far this year (2020), the CDC reports 81 cases in 31 states (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2020/disease-cases-state-2020.htm).

The 3 recent cases in Middlesex county, Massachusetts suggest that there may be a focus of transmission in that locality of the state. Transmission of WNV across the USA will occur until the onset of killing frosts ends mosquito activity for the year.

Since a commercial human WNV vaccine is not available, individuals living in localities where human or horse cases have occurred this summer (2020), or where positive mosquitoes have been trapped, should follow the recommendations given above to avoid mosquito bites. Horse owners should vaccinate their animals. - Mod.TY

In a little more than 15 days, the region has registered 40 dead monkeys in the cities of Santa Rosa de Lima, Rio Fortuna, Sao Martinho, Grao-Para and Braco do Norte, with 24 in just one week.

Teams from regional Health Surveillance and the Zoonoses Surveillance Unit (UVZ), Tubarao Municipal Health Foundation (FMS), issued an alert about the possibility of yellow fever cases that could be causing the deaths of monkeys in municipalities of the region.

Several days ago, 8 dead monkeys were collected that were encountered in the Santa Rosa de Lima region, the results of which still have not been issued. However, the alert was made due to the increase in cases.

According to the biologist Sabrina Fernandes Cardoso of the State Health Secretariat, the 1st results of the test are expected at the beginning of next week. \"It is worrisome because there is no apparent cause of death of these animals, with no signs of aggression or accident. In addition to this, the monkeys that were seen constantly by the residents have disappeared,\" she stated.

The alert has been issued because the appearance of dead monkeys in a given region could indicate the presence of the virus that causes yellow fever. When such an event is detected, the viscera of the animals is taken out and sent for testing in the laboratory in order to confirm, or not, the presence of this virus in these animals, which are considered to be sentinels.

\"The entire locality is being mapped for vaccination coverage of the residents. Epidemiological surveillance teams are visiting house-by-house and orienting the residents. A point to underscore is the increase in vaccination against yellow fever, which is available in all the health posts,\" stated Sabrina, the biologist.

Municipal residents who by chance encounter a dead monkey are being instructed to go to the nearest health unit to report it. Then, the health team must note the data and communicate it to the Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance, which will take the necessary measures.

[The possible (probable) confirmation of yellow fever among the non-human primates under investigation should not be a surprise. On the contrary, it will only confirm the intense circulation of the virus in Santa Catarina, as reported by ProMED-PORT. - Mod.RNA

The deaths of monkeys in a given area over a short period is characteristic of the sylvan (forest) yellow fever virus transmission cycle. The prompt response of local health authorities to alert the local population to the situation and determine yellow fever vaccination coverage is prudent.

Active transmission of the virus among monkeys carries with it the risk of spillover to humans and ongoing transmission in the urban cycle, which could spread rapidly in a human population with inadequate vaccination coverage. - Mod.TY
