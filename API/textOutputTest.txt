CUTANEOUS AND RENAL GLOMERULAR VASCULOPATHY, CANINE - UK (02): (ENGLAND) DOG **************************************************************************** A ProMED-mail post http://www.promedmail.org ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases http://www.isid.org Date: Wed 10 Mar 2021 Source: North Yorkshire Live [abridged, edited] https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/new-case-deadly-dog-disease-20060373 Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists confirmed today [Wed 10 Mar 2021] that there have been another 3 positive cases of the deadly disease in the UK. This includes a case in Knaresborough.  A spokesperson said: "Unfortunately, we have to confirm a further 3 cases of Alabama Rot, also known as CRGV (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy). The cases were from Preston (Lancashire), Knaresborough (N.Yorkshire) and Poole (Dorset). In total, the UK has now seen 271 confirmed cases with 20 cases in 2021. This disease is still rare, so we're advising dog owners to remain calm but vigilant, and seek advice from their local vet if their dog develops unexplained skin lesions." There have been 8 cases of Alabama Rot in Yorkshire in recent years. It can only be confirmed if a post mortem is carried out on an animal after death. Cases have been confirmed in Huddersfield, Leeds, Otley, Keighley and Ripon, to name a few. The condition is officially called CRGV, but it was named after the state in America where it was 1st found. It is a disease caused by damage to the blood vessels in the skin and kidney and causes tiny blood clots to form, which blocks them and can lead to damage of the affected tissue, ultimately leading to either skin lesions or kidney failure. Without urgent treatment, dogs develop an intense fever which can sometimes kill them. No breed is immune to it, and the disease seems to thrive in wet conditions. [Byline: Danielle Hoe] -- Communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [A "frequently asked questions" document addressing Alabama rot in the UK by the Royal Veterinary College (University of London), last updated 6 Feb 2020, is available at  https://www.rvc.ac.uk/small-animal-vet/news/alabama-rot-in-the-uk-frequently-asked-questions . The clinico-pathological features of CRGV as observed in the UK since 2012 have been summarised, analysed, and presented in a (conveniently illustrated) Veterinary Record paper, published online 21 Jan 2021 (Ref 1). The Abstract and Conclusion chapters follow. "1. Abstract - Background: 178 dogs with cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) were evaluated to further the understanding of the natural course of CRGV. CRGV, a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, can cause skin lesions and potentially acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high mortality rate. - Methods: Cases were submitted from multiple practices from 2012 until June 2019. Clinical histories and laboratory data were reviewed to describe the features of CRGV. - Results: Most cases (91%) occurred between November and May. 15 dogs (8.4%) with CRGV were in contact with another dog that developed skin lesions/AKI. Limb lesions were present on 144 dogs (80.9%) at presentation. Median time from appearance of a lesion to AKI was 3 days (range around 4-45 days). Neurological signs occurred in 33 dogs (18.6%) including at presentation in 2 (1.1%). Systemic signs were present in 13 dogs prior to a skin lesion (7.3%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed prior to AKI identification in 92 of 170 dogs (54.1%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 115 of 137 (83.9%) of dogs. - Conclusion: The timeframe over which AKI may develop is longer than previously reported, neurological signs can be identified at presentation or during hospitalisation, and thrombocytopenia is even more common than previously reported." "2. Conclusion CRGV remains a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of unknown aetiology, which imparts a grave prognosis when clinically significant azotaemia develops. It is unclear why there has been a yearly variation in case numbers, and further epidemiological study is required. This updated report provides clarification on the expected features of the disease in the UK and helps guide clinicians as to when to suspect CRGV as a major differential. The report highlights that neurological signs may be a feature of the disease including at initial presentation, identifies a greater range in time from skin lesions to development of AKI, and identified that NSAID use is prevalent at initial presentation which may be concerning given the potential nephrotoxicity of these medications. It is likely that some cases of CRGV in the UK remain non-azotaemic, and it is possible that there are more surviving cases than the authors are aware of. Further research into the underlying aetiology of CRGV is required to help identify triggers, define prognostic indicators and to determine optimal management." References 1.

MYCOBACTERIUM ABSCESSUS - UK: (ENGLAND) ex IRAQ, NOSOCOMIAL, POST-AUTOLOGOUS FAT TRANSFER ***************************************************************************************** A ProMED-mail post http://www.promedmail.org ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases http://www.isid.org Date: Fri 26 Feb 2021 From: Giorgio Calisti <giorgio.calisti@mft.nhs.uk> [edited] I am treating in Manchester (UK) a patient that developed _Mycobacterium abscessus_ disseminated skin disease following cosmetic surgery at a hospital in Iraq. She underwent the operation in September 2020. The operation consisted of liposuction from the abdomen and [autologous] fat transfer to the breasts, hands and calves. Two weeks later she developed the infection in all sites where the fat was grafted. The patient herself has contacted the hospital and has been informed that there are 4 other cases (not including the patient I am treating) who reside in Iraq and have developed the same infection after cosmetic procedures in the same hospital. I have been in contact with the surgeon, and an infectious diseases specialist has contacted me to ask advice on treatment of one of the other cases. I asked for more details regarding how many patients have been affected by this surgical outbreak and what mitigating actions have been implemented, but unfortunately I have not had any reply yet.   The most likely stage of the surgical procedure where contamination may have occurred in our patient is at the time of extracorporeal fat filtration, following fat aspiration from the abdomen and before fat reinjection to the breasts, hands and calves. Different methods can be used in the fat filtration stage. These include centrifugation, mechanical filtering using a fine mesh, or filtration through a mesh under suction power. Depending on the system used and the level of cleaning and disinfection of the materials, autologous fat contamination with environmental organisms such as _Mycobacterium abscessus_ can occur. Contamination with different strains of rapidly growing mycobacteria and with other environmental organisms can theoretically occur in the same patient or in different patients being exposed to the same contaminated materials. [The patient] I am treating is a] 35-year-old woman with a background of hypothyroidism and asthma. Resident in the UK, she travelled to Iraq to have the above-described procedure. Two weeks after the operation, having returned to the UK, she developed painful nodules and abscesses over her arms, legs, and breasts at the fat injection sites. She was initially treated by her GP and by plastic surgeons in Manchester with several courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and incision and drainage of some of the abscesses with very little benefit.   She came to our attention in November 2020, and we sent further surgical samples for mycobacterial culture, which grew _Mycobacterium abscessus_. The organism was identified by whole genome sequencing analysis carried out at the National Mycobacteria Reference Service (NMRS -- Central & North) in Birmingham (UK). No mutations associated with macrolide resistance were detected. Pending the phenotypic susceptibility results, she was started on IV amikacin, oral azithromycin, oral clofazimine and IV tigecycline. She developed acute pancreatitis likely caused by tigecycline, which had to be stopped in January 2021. Phenotypic susceptibility results became available in January 2021: clarithromycin 8 mcg/mL, borderline high; amikacin 16 mcg/mL, sensitive; tobramycin 16 mcg/mL, resistant; cefoxitin 64 mcg/mL, intermediate; imipenem 64 mcg/mL, no defined breakpoints; cotrimoxazole greater than 8/152 mcg/mL, resistant; linezolid 32 mcg/mL, resistant; ciprofloxacin greater than 4 mcg/mL, resistant; moxifloxacin greater than 8 mcg/mL, resistant; doxycycline greater than 16 mcg/mL, resistant; tigecycline 0.25 mcg/mL, no defined breakpoints. Based on the results above, we switched the treatment regime to the following combination: oral rifabutin 300 mg once a day; oral azithromycin 500 mg once a day; oral clofazimine 100 mg once a day; IV amikacin 15 mg/kg once a day; IV Recarbrio (imipenem-relebactam) 500 mg-250 mg twice a day; IV imipenem 500 mg twice a day (as a "top up" of imipenem in addition to Recarbrio). The patient remains on this regime to date [26 Feb 2021]. She is receiving it as OPAT [outpatient antibiotic therapy]. She is responding very well to treatment. We will treat her for 9-12 months in total, depending on how she continues to respond. After the first 3 months of induction, we will probably simplify the regimen. I have minimal information unfortunately [on the other patients in this outbreak]. I know from the infectious diseases physician in Iraq that one of the patients was not responding well to treatment, which was suboptimal. I informed him of our identification and sensitivity results and suggested treatment options for the patient he is treating, aware that some of these options may be difficult to get ahold of locally. -- Communicated by: Dr. Giorgio Calisti Consultant in Infectious Diseases Wythenshawe Hospital Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust United Kingdom <giorgio.calisti@mft.nhs.uk> [ProMED thanks Dr. Giorgio Calisti for submission of this case report. _Mycobacteroides abscessus_ (formerly _Mycobacterium abscessus_) is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), i.e., an acid-fast bacillus that is part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex ( http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html ). NTMs differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. RGMs produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. The _M. abscessus_ complex includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_, and _M. bolletii_. NTMs are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems. Water from these systems can contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury when the wound is contaminated by soil. _M. abscessus_ also can cause respiratory tract infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Tattoo ink contaminated during the manufacturing process or when diluted with non-sterile water has been implicated in various outbreaks of tattoo-associated _M. abscessus_ infections (see ProMED post Mycobacterium abscessus - Argentina: (SF) tattooing   20190627.6540973 ). Water from dental unit water lines was implicated in causing several large outbreaks of _M. abscessus_ dental infections when the water was used to irrigate the dental wound ( https://www.iccs-home.com/dential-infection-update-pulpotomy-procedures-and-mycobacterial-in-children  and  https://www.jwatch.org/na41029/2016/04/12/mycobacterium-abscessus-infection-dental-procedure ). An outbreak of abdominal wall wound infections due to the same strain of _M. abscessus_ was reported in a group of 8 US patients who had abdominal liposuction at one overseas clinic ( https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/8/1181/360629 ). These patients had traveled abroad to receive their medical care, labeled as "lipotourism," as may have happened in the patient described in the case report above. Abscesses at the site of liposuction, without fever or leukocytosis, were said to characterize the infection in these patients ( https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/8/1181/360629 ). _M. abscessus_ infection at sites of autologous fat transfer for soft tissue augmentation following liposuction was reported in 12 patients at several private hospitals in China ( https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/sur.2019.270 ). The injection procedure in all these patients was said to use a 27-gauge needle to transfer fat from donor site to recipient site after processing through gauze filtration. No definite source of contamination was implicated in these patients. _M. abscessus_ is a notoriously multidrug-resistant organism. It is resistant to most beta-lactams, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and to a broad-spectrum, chromosomally encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/ ). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem the most activity against _M. abscessus_ ( https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586 ). Imipenem is currently recommended as part of first-line treatments for _M. abscessus_ infections. Meropenem, another carbapenem, is less active than is imipenem when used alone against _M. abscessus_. BlaMab is resistant to inhibition by the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam and sulbactam ( https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297 ). However, 2 newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- relebactam (marketed with imipenem) and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of both these carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8  and  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/ ). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, e.g., amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8 ). The erm(41) gene, which confers inducible macrolide resistance through methylation of ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ complex organisms ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/ ). Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ ( https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR ). Infection with _M. abscessus_ is usually treated with a combination therapy of amikacin, tigecycline, cefoxitin, and imipenem, combined with oral clarithromycin or azithromycin, if the patient's isolate is macrolide susceptible, for one month, followed by a combination of clofazimine, linezolid, minocycline, moxifloxacin or cotrimoxazole for 12 months, depending on results of susceptibility testing.

A 3km [approx. 1.8 mi] Protection Zone and 10km [approx. 6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around the infected premises. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> [The conclusion of the last outbreak assessment report for the cases in both LPAI and HPAI in UK and Europe, published on 10 Nov 2020 by DEFRA-APHA, mentioned that: "As a consequence of the H5N8 HPAI poultry outbreak in the UK, and in Germany and the Netherlands; as well as the increasing HPAI H5N8 events in wild birds in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands and Germany this week, and the known migration routes on to the UK from these countries; the risk of HPAI incursion in wild birds in the UK is High. The overall risk of infection of poultry in the UK is Medium; although it should be noted that the risk of introduction to individual premises depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on farm to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds. We recommend biosecurity measures should be maintained or strengthened, as required. "We strongly recommend that all poultry keepers (including backyard keepers) review their biosecurity measures and business continuity plans, as the risk has now increased. Keepers should familiarize themselves with government guidance on good biosecurity and how to report suspicion of disease appropriately".

Testing today [on 3 Nov 2020] has confirmed that this is a highly pathogenic strain related to the virus currently circulating in Europe. All 13 500 birds at the farm will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 3-km Protection Zone and a 10-km Surveillance Zone have been put in place around the infected site to limit the risk of the disease spreading. This case is unrelated to the H5N2 strain which was confirmed at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent on Mon 2 Nov 2020 [see OIE report above. - Mod.CRD]. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. -- Communicated by: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> [Netherlands has reported, since 17 Oct 2020, HPAI H5N8-infected mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and a Eurasian Wigeon (_Mareca penelope_) found dead in 3 sites. This is the 1st outbreak of H5N8 HPAI officially reported in the Netherlands since the last detection of H5N8 HPAI in April 2017 in wild mallards; it is also the 1st HPAI outbreak in western Europe this season. The H5N8 HPAI introduction in the country is most likely related to wild bird migration. Germany reported a case in a wild bird on 30 Oct 2020 (  20201103.7912764 ). The case involved a Eurasian Wigeon found ill in Hamburg, subsequently testing positive for HPAI and euthanized. Germany has been on high alert for HPAI since the beginning of October 2020 and increased surveillance efforts. There have been further outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 in Russia, including outbreaks in poultry in the west of the country on 27 Oct 2020 following previous outbreaks in poultry, and cases in wild water-birds in southern central Russia, along the border with Kazakhstan, and in northern Kazakhstan's poultry. The said and additional information is available in DEFRA's updated assessment of 30 Oct 2020 (Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in Europe, at  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932205/hpai-netherlands-poa-201030.pdf ). The assessment is a reminder that the Eurasian Wigeon is strongly migratory and is a common winter visitor to Great Britain. On 30 Sep 2020, ECDC (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) published a warning on increased risk of HPAI introduction. The warning followed HPAI outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan over the past few months. This region is a known autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe. The warning indicated that northern and eastern Europe are very vulnerable to new outbreaks, given past experience. When HPAI was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe: "If the pattern is repeated this year [2020], HPAI is expected to arrive in the same areas of Europe in autumn or winter. Subsequent spread to countries in southern and western Europe is also possible." The warning, urging EU states to step up surveillance and biosecurity measures to guard against possible new outbreaks of avian influenza this year [2020], is available at  https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/avian-influenza-eu-alert-new-outbreaks . Subscribers are encouraged to visit the recent commentary by wildlife moderator PMB on the HPAI situation in Europe at  https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7912764 . The risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses to the general public in Europe remains very low. However, to minimize the risk of transmission to humans, people are advised not to not touch dead birds without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. - Mod.AS] [Further information on these cases in the UK, including the restrictions and movement controls, can be seen at Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) "Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)" website at  https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation , (latest update 3 Nov 2020). "Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu: "These include: - Keeping the area where birds live clean and tidy, controlling rats and mice and regularly cleansing and disinfecting any hard surfaces - Cleaning footwear before and after visits - Placing birds' feed and water in fully enclosed areas that are protected from wild birds, and removing any spilled feed regularly - Putting fencing around outdoor areas where birds are allowed and limiting their access to ponds or areas visited by wild waterfowl - Where possible, avoid keeping ducks and geese with other poultry species." - Mod.CRD HealthMap/ProMED map: England, United Kingdom:  http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279 ]  See Also

FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - MAURITIUS: (RODRIGUES) BOVINE, SUSPECTED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ****************************************************************************************** A ProMED-mail post http://www.promedmail.org ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases http://www.isid.org Date: Thu 11 Mar 2021 Source: Lemauricien [in French, trans. edited] http://www.lemauricien.com/actualites/fievre-aphteuse-un-cas-suspect-detecte-a-rodrigues/408800/ The veterinary service of the Ministry of Agro-Industry was notified of a suspected case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in Rodrigues yesterday [Wed 10 Mar 2021] by the Agriculture Commission. Samples taken for analysis will be sent to the ANSES laboratory in France, thanks to the support and logistical facilitation of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC). The International Organization of Epizootics (OIE) has also been notified of this suspected case. As a precautionary measure, no transport of livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs) from Rodrigues to Mauritius will be authorized until further notice. -- Communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [Rodrigues is one of the 4 islands enclosed in the Republic of Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km (1200 miles) off the southeast coast of the African continent, east of Madagascar. The main island, called Mauritius, is about 600 km [about 373 miles] southwest of Rodrigues; the other islands are Agalega and St. Brandon. In July 2016, Mauritius suffered its 1st OIE-reported FMD outbreak, starting in Rodrigues, most likely introduced by import of animals from the African continent, spreading to the main island, Mauritius. The OIE "immediate notification" included the following epidemiological comments: "1st case in Rodrigues was on 7 Jul 2016 and treated as an isolated case. Since there was a continuous increase in the number of cases, blood samples were collected and analysed at the Animal Health Laboratory at Reduit, in Mauritius. 1st positive FMD diagnosis was done by competitive ELISA. Another positive diagnosis from cattle in Mauritius was on 5 Aug 2016 by competitive ELISA. Confirmation from Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) in South Africa is awaited. The French Food Security Agency (ANSES) has confirmed FMD virus by PCR and virus isolation; serotype O has been confirmed by antigen detection ELISA on viral isolate;" (  20160819.4424865 ).

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 UPDATE (97): TESTING, CONTACT TRACING, VARIANTS, IMMUNITY, WHO *************************************************************************************** A ProMED-mail post http://www.promedmail.org ProMED-mail is a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases http://www.isid.org In this update: [1] Interpretation of molecular testing [2] Germany: Cross-border contact tracing [3] Variants [4] Immunity [5] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 13 Mar 2021) [6] Global update: Worldometer accessed 13 Mar 2021 21:10 EST (GMT-5) ****** [1] Interpretation of molecular testing Date: 11 Mar 2021 Source: EuroSurveillance [edited] https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.10.2001134 Background Sensitive molecular diagnostics and correct test interpretation are crucial for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis and thereby essential for good clinical practice. Furthermore, they are a key factor in outbreak control where active case finding in combination with isolation and contact tracing are crucial. Aim With the objective to inform the public health and laboratory responses to the pandemic, we reviewed current published knowledge on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection as assessed by RNA molecular detection in a wide range of clinical samples. Methods We performed an extensive search on studies published between 1 Dec 2019 and 15 May 2020, reporting on molecular detection and/or isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in any human laboratory specimen. Results We compiled a dataset of 264 studies including 32 515 COVID-19 cases, and additionally aggregated data points (n=2777) from sampling of 217 adults with a known infection timeline. We summarised data on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, blood, oral fluid, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid; where provided, we also summarised specific observations on SARS-CoV-2 detection in pregnancy, infancy, children, adolescents and immunocompromised individuals. Conclusion Optimal SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing relies on choosing the most appropriate sample type, collected with adequate sampling technique and with the infection timeline in mind. We outlined knowledge gaps and directions for future well-documented systematic studies. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> ****** [2] Germany: Cross-border contact tracing Date: 11 Mar 2021 Source: EuroSurveillance [edited] https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.10.2001236 Introduction  The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) managed the exchange of cross-border contact tracing data between public health authorities (PHA) in Germany and abroad during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Aim We describe the extent of cross-border contact tracing and its challenges. Methods We analysed cross-border COVID-19 contact tracing events from 3 Feb to 5 Apr 2020 using information exchanged through the European Early Warning Response System and communication with International Health Regulation national focal points. We described events by PHA, number of contacts, and exposure context. Results The RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1099 times (median = 1; interquartile range (IQR): 1 2) and sharing data on 5099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (n = 64; 20%), cruise ships (n = 24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (n = 210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (median = 10; IQR: 2 16, median = 4; IQR: 2 11) and more contact persons (median = 60; IQR: 9 269, median = 2; IQR: 1 3) than non-transport exposures (median = 1; IQR: 1 6 and median = 1; IQR: 12). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3 9). Conclusion In the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload. The numerous communications highlight the need for fast and efficient global outbreak communication channels between public health authorities. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [Contact tracing is a tried-and-tested public health intervention intended to identify individuals who may have been in contact with an infected person and advise them to take action that will disrupt chains of transmission. Prior to Covid-19, contact tracing was often used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections and has been heralded as vital to the eradication of smallpox in the UK. According to modelling published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a combination of self-isolation, effective contact tracing, and social distancing measures may be the most effective and efficient way to control the spread of Covid-19 ( https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30457-6/fulltext ). However, for contact tracing to be at its most effective, the modelling estimates that for every 1000 new symptomatic cases, 15 000 to 41 000 contacts would have to be asked to self-isolate. Clearly, the logistical burden of operating a manual contract tracing system is high. In October 2020, The European Commission (EC) activated its interoperability gateway service for national contact tracing apps in Germany, Republic of Ireland, and Italy, allowing the encrypted data of millions of people related to Covid-19 (coronavirus) infections to be transferred across borders. Interoperability through the gateway service will be possible for a total of 20 apps based on decentralised systems. The interoperability gateway service (gateway) is a digital infrastructure that ensures the secure transmission of generated keys between the backend servers of participating national contact tracing and warning apps. While doing so, the gateway will share the minimum information necessary for a person to be alerted if they have been exposed to an infected person also using one of the participating apps. The data exchanged will only be stored in the gateway for a maximum period of 14 days. No other information except the keys, generated by the national apps, will be handled by the gateway [ https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1905#gateway ]. The cross-border system does not allow "identification of individual persons," and doesn't track user's location "or movement of devices." Information is "only stored as long as necessary" to trace infections [ https://www.mobileworldlive.com/apps/news-apps/ec-launches-cross-border-contact-tracing-tech]. Digital contact tracing may prove to be key to the safe re-opening of the tourism sector and enable users to easily and securely be contact traced across borders. This is an important step in ensuring real time data sharing across borders, which will contribute towards better preparedness and response capacity at points of entry (POEs). - Mod.UBA] ****** [3] Variants [A] Philippines Date: 13 Mar 2021 Source: Al Jazeera [edited] <https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/13/philippines-reports-first-brazil-covid-variant-as-new-cases The Philippines, which has the 2nd-highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in South East Asia, is battling a renewed surge as it ramps up a vaccination drive that started on 1 Mar 2021. The Philippines has detected its 1st case of the highly contagious coronavirus variant 1st identified in Brazil, the health department said, as the number of infections surges to the highest level in 6 months. A Filipino returning from Brazil tested positive for the P.1 variant after 752 samples were sequenced at the genome centre, the department said in a statement on Sat 13 Mar 2021. It reported 59 new infections of the B.1.1.7 variant 1st detected in the United Kingdom, and 32 cases of the B.1.351 variant discovered in South Africa. This brings cases for those variants to 177 and 90, respectively. "Correct and consistent adherence to the minimum public health standards will prevent the transmission of these variants," the department said. The department also reported 13 cases "with mutations of possible clinical significance." On Fri 12 Mar 2021, the country reported 4578 new coronavirus infections, the biggest daily increase in cases in nearly 6 months. That brings the total number of confirmed cases to 611 618. The number of deaths reached 12 694, with 87 fatalities added. The renewed surge in COVID-19 cases has prompted mayors in the capital, Manila, an urban sprawl of 16 cities, to impose an evening curfew until the end of March 2021 and remind the public to practise physical distancing. The latest developments also come as Japanese health officials reported on Fri 12 Mar 2021 a new COVID-19 variant in a traveller from the Philippines. Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said that the person's coronavirus sample tested positive for E484K and N501Y mutations. "The variant is distinct from those initially discovered in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil, and is thought to pose a similar level of threat," Kyodo news agency was quoted as saying.

RT-PCR spike gene target late detection (SGTL) can constitute a useful surrogate to track B.1.1.7 spread, besides the spike gene target failure (SGTF) proxy. SGTL/SGTF samples were associated with statistically significant higher viral loads, but not with substantial shift in age distribution compared to non-SGTF/SGTL cases. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [The study used SARS-CoV2 spike gene target failure (SGTF) and spike gene target late (SGTL) detection RT-PCR data as proxies for monitoring B.1.1.7 circulation, and reported that increase in the proportion of spike gene target failure and spike gene target late detection samples correlated with the spread of the new variant of concern. - Mod.UBA] ------ [C] Canada Date: 12 Mar 2021 Source: Global News [edited] https://globalnews.ca/news/7693373/covid-19-variants-of-concern-canada-cases/ Coronavirus cases and outbreaks of new, more transmissible variants are continuing to increase across Canada, raising concerns of a possible 3rd wave of the ongoing pandemic in the country. As of 11 Mar 2021, there were close to 3000 confirmed cases of "variants of concern" (VOC) across all 10 provinces, with the B.1.1.7 variant accounting for more than 90 per cent of these cases. The B.1.1.7 variant was 1st detected in the United Kingdom in mid-December 2020. All viruses mutate over time, but the pace of the spread and the reproductive rate of the new variants in the country is "very concerning," experts say. "We are starting a variant-driven 3rd wave now," said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto. The province of Ontario has the highest number of variant cases: 956 of the UK variant; 41 of the B.1.351 variant; and 28 of the P.1 variant. Those variants were 1st discovered in South Africa and Brazil, respectively. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table estimates that 41 per cent of the total cases are of VOCs. Projections for Ontario released on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] estimated that in the next 2 to 3 weeks, COVID-19 rates could grow to up to 8000 new cases a day under the worst-case scenario, depending on the spread of variants. Jean-Paul Soucy, an infectious disease epidemiologist and PhD student at the University of Toronto, noted that cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, which is responsible for an increasing fraction of infections across the country, were able to grow under lockdown conditions even as conventional COVID-19 cases shrank. "We are facing a 'twindemic here,'" he told Global News. Alberta has the 2nd-highest number of VOC cases (775) but has yet to report the P.1 variant. Alberta is followed by British Columbia and Quebec, where all 3 variants have been found. Given B.1.1.7's prevalence and competitive advantage in reproduction, Donald Sheppard, an immunologist and microbiologist at McGill University Health Centre, says Canada has passed the "tipping point" where it will replace the original strain of coronavirus. Provincial modelling out of both Quebec and Ontario suggests that the B.1.1.7 variant could dominate in the provinces in a matter of weeks. "The variants of concern continue to spread across Ontario, and our ability to control the rate of spread will determine whether we return to normal or we face a 3rd wave of infection," Dr Adalsteinn Brown, the co-chair of Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said during a news conference on Thu 11 Mar 2021. Experts are concerned that the variants could also delay the end of the pandemic, that has now entered its 2nd year. "I fear the spread of more transmissible and potentially more deadly variants will lead to one last, preventable tragedy," said Soucy. Sheppard said had there been no variants of concern, we would be looking at winding down the pandemic over the summer. On a positive note, however, there is emerging evidence that the current vaccines appear to be effective against the new variants. However, a number of studies have shown decreased protection of the COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.351 and P.1 variant. Both contain the E484K mutation in the spike protein of the virus, which appears to have an impact on the body's immune response and vaccine efficacy. Over the next few weeks and months, Canada is set to receive a heavy influx of vaccine supplies. As a larger percentage of the population gets vaccinated, the mass vaccination campaigns will eventually help reduce transmission and suppress the variants, Soucy said. But until then, public health measures and personal vigilance will be key, he said. Furness predicts that schools will likely need to close briefly in April 2021. Meanwhile, as daily case counts have stabilized, a number of provinces have eased restrictions in recent weeks. "If we take a more gradual approach to reopening and take a proactive approach in regions to halt accelerating growth, I think we will be in great shape for a COVID-safe summer and a vigorous vaccination campaign to lead us out of this mess," Soucy said.

All the vaccines aim to prevent disease primarily (but not exclusively) by eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block spike and therefore prevent the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. The 95% efficacy of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (from Pfizer/BioNTech) heralded a series of results showing that eliciting neutralizing antibodies to spike strongly correlated with protection from disease in clinical trials of various vaccines. Currently, there is concern about reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants that have mutations in the spike protein. Coronaviruses are very large and complex compared with other RNA viruses (around 4 times the size of the hepatitis A virus genome), and their replication fidelity must, therefore, be higher. Despite this, once a pathogen has been allowed to infect more than 100 million people, it is not a surprise that sequence variants with a selective advantage emerge. Toward the latter part of 2020, just as regulators were granting approvals to a series of vaccines based largely on the wildtype "Wuhan" sequence spike antigen, several SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" were detected. These variants have potentially enhanced transmission, pathogenicity, immune escape, or a combination of all 3. The 1st sequences of a variant of concern that emerged in the UK, B.1.1.7 (also called 501Y.V1), emerged in September 2020. It includes 8 amino acid changes within spike. One of these, N501Y (Asn501-Tyr), increases the affinity of spike for its cellular target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and, together with other less well characterized mutations, has resulted in enhanced transmission (recognized since December 2020) and possibly enhanced pathogenicity. Might this variant also escape antibody-mediated immunity? Muick et al. examined the ability of immune sera from 40 older or younger 2-dose BNT162b2 vaccine recipients for neutralization of a pseudotype virus (a safe, surrogate virus engineered to express spike) carrying wild-type sequence spike or all of the B.1.1.7 spike mutations. The sera had a wide range of neutralizing antibody titers measured against the wild-type spike, from around 1/50 to around 1/1200. Although there was a significant reduction in geometric mean titers for the younger (though not the older) cohort against the B.1.1.7 variant, the authors argue that on the basis of our understanding of other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, an overall reduced titer of some 20% would not be predicted to meaningfully reduce vaccine efficacy. However, such findings confirm that the B.1.1.7 spike mutations affect not only transmission but also immune recognition. Another study looked in considerable detail at potential vaccine escape by B.1.1.7. They considered immune sera from 23 vaccinees with a mean age of 82, analyzed 3 weeks after a single dose of BNT162b2. Using a pseudotype virus carrying spike with all 8 mutations led to a 6-fold reduction of neutralization for the majority of sera. In this older cohort, the ablation of functional neutralization was more apparent in those starting with lower antibody titers to the wild-type sequence spike. A parallel dataset for pseudotype neutralization of wild-type sequence or B.1.1.7 spike by mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) vaccinee sera detects a more marginal reduction in activity against the variant. When population variation can mean that people develop diverse neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination, the extent to which a small drop in neutralization endangers protection from symptomatic disease depends to some extent on the immunogenicity of the vaccine and how much margin it leaves for protection. This issue is starting to be addressed through analyses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccinees in the UK. Although neutralizing antibody titer against B.1.1.7 was reduced approximately 9-fold (from a mean of about 1/500 neutralizing antibody titer against wild-type virus), this did not affect vaccine efficacy because there was no enhanced susceptibility to infection [as determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing] attributable to the variant among the 499 participants who became infected. Although the B.1.1.7 variant has had massive impact in exacerbating caseload and severity across many countries, there is even greater concern about variants that carry additional immune evasion mutations, notably the E484K (Glu484-Lys) mutation found in the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant that emerged in South Africa, the P.1 variant found in Brazil, and sporadic examples from UK sequencing that show E484K on the B.1.1.7 background. That the immune evasion mutations -- K417N (Lys417-Asn), E484K, and N501Y -- can arise in evolution experiments in vitro involving culture of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of immune sera offers caution against suboptimal vaccination regimens. Concern about the B.1.351 variant derives from analyses of its effects on neutralization activity. The variant shows substantial ablation of any virus-neutralizing activity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Preliminary data suggest a reduced neutralizing response in sera from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees and reduced efficacy in preventing mild to moderate COVID-19. This supports the view that neutralizing antibody titer is the key correlate of protection (CoP). Although analysis based on loss of in vitro neutralizing activity by individual mAbs representing the 3 dominant classes of epitopes on spike offers strong evidence for immune evasion by the variants, the effect is less pronounced at the level of polyclonal immune serum after convalescence or vaccination. This suggests that the neutralizing repertoire is broader and more resilient than so far documented. Findings from studies with mAbs offer caution for using these therapeutically, given their vulnerability to loss of individual epitopes and also their ability to drive selection of variants that can evade immune recognition. Of course, the flip side of this argument is that detailed mapping of the neutralizing antibody epitopes in spike can facilitate the design of broadly neutralizing vaccines and mAbs that can target numerous spike mutants. It has been posited that SARS-CoV-2 may continue to accumulate mutations that evade immune responses. But as previously explored for other viruses, such as HIV, immune evasion often comes at a biological fitness cost to the virus, tending to impose an upper limit to the number of mutations that can be afforded when faced with a broad, neutralizing antibody repertoire. Additionally, given that similar mutations arise recurrently in spike, presumably through convergent evolution in geographically distinct isolates, it is possible that the spike variants offering a survival advantage to the virus will be constrained and finite. Furthermore, a spike protein that mutates residues A, B, and C to evade antibody recognition runs the structural risk of generating a new neutralizing epitope, D. Therefore, a finite number of iterative vaccines could target key variants, but this would not necessarily have to be reappraised annually as with influenza virus vaccines. Seasonal "common cold" human coronaviruses tend to appear with 2-year cycles, and recent data for one of these suggest that antigenic drift (mutations that undermine immune recognition) may underlie escape from acquired immunity. T cell immunity is likely to feature as an additional CoP against COVID-19 (13). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response encompasses specificity to several hundred epitopes across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome, the majority of which are unimpaired in the variants. Even those T cell epitopes that are altered in the SARS-CoV-2 variants will in most cases bind to the different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules that present antigenic peptides to T cells, although binding affinities may be altered. It would be helpful to investigate whether T cell immunity is modified by the SARS-CoV-2 variants. The assessment of variants on neutralization are complicated by the variability of pseudotype assays used in these studies. It would be helpful to have standardized live-virus in vitro neutralization assays as internationally comparable reference points. As ever, these are discussions that must be tethered to some sense of CoP values. Although much debated, many researchers have the sense that people with a neutralizing antibody IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) greater than around 1/100 serum dilution would likely be safe from infection, or at least from symptomatic infection. Given that these are highly potent vaccines that often induce neutralizing antibody responses with IC50 of at least 1/1000, there is hopefully a reasonable safety margin before reduced recognition of variants means that effective protection is lost. Ultimately, the best defense against emergence of further variants of concern is a rapid, global, vaccination campaign in concert with other public health measures to block transmission. A virus that cannot transmit and infect others has no chance to mutate. -- communicated by: ProMED rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka ------ [B] Immunity after one vaccine dose in previously infected Date: 12 Mar 2021 Source: via ProMED-ESP [in Spanish, edited] https://www.redaccionmedica.com/secciones/sanidad-hoy/vacuna-covid-inmunidad-fuerte-solo-una-dosis-infectados-9888 https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-infection-one-shot-two-dose-coronavirus-vaccine Covid-19 - USA: RNA vaccines, immunity after one dose in previously infected persons ---------- Only one dose of Covid vaccine [can be given] for those who have previously had the disease: In English:  https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-infection-one-shot-two-dose-coronavirus-vaccine -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [Jennifer Dan and colleagues, in Science in Feb 2021, concluded that "Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19, involving all 4 major types of immune memory.

Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among US health care personnel. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(3): e211283. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1283 Key points Question: What risk factors are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity among health care personnel (HCP) inside and outside the workplace? Findings: In this cross-sectional study of 24 749 HCP in 3 US states, contact with an individual with known coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure outside the workplace was the strongest risk factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, along with living in a zip code with higher COVID-19 incidence. None of the assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity. Meaning: In this study, most risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP were outside the workplace, suggesting that current infection prevention strategies in health care are effective in preventing patient-to-HCP transmission in the workplace. Abstract Importance: Risks for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care personnel (HCP) are unclear. Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP with the a priori hypothesis that community exposure but not healthcare exposure was associated with seropositivity. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted among volunteer HCP at 4 large healthcare systems in 3 US states. Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set. Residential weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence was calculated from state-based COVID-19 case and census data. Exposures: Model variables included demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity), community (known COVID-19 contact, COVID-19 cumulative incidence by 3-digit zip code prefix), and healthcare (workplace, job role, COVID-19 patient contact) factors. Main outcome and measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site. Results: Among 24 749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17 233 [69.6%]), were women (19 361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15 157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12 413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 in the community up to one week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20 072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). No assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity, including nurse job role (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), working in the emergency department (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3), or workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3). Conclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US HCP in 3 states, community exposures were associated with seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, but workplace factors, including workplace role, environment, or contact with patients with known COVID-19, were not. These findings provide reassurance that current infection prevention practices in diverse healthcare settings are effective in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> ---- [B] Invited commentary Date: Wed 10 Mar 2021 Source: Journal of the American Medical Association [abridged, edited] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777310 ref: Gohil SK, Huang SS.

JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(3): e211575. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1575 This study represents one of the largest assessments of COVID-19 seroprevalence among HCP in the USA, and its findings highlight the protective effects of PPE and protocols in the hospital setting. These findings help correct misperceptions that HCP remain at higher risk of communicable disease despite adequate PPE and infection prevention protocols. In the early phases of the pandemic, infection prevention programs across the nation spent significant time and effort to address HCP fears and provide education and reassurance related to PPE effectiveness. More data are needed on how to optimize HCP adherence to infection prevention protocols, including speaking up about symptoms and avoiding working while ill. Finally, the reassurance that infection prevention protocols and PPE are effective should not undermine the front-line contribution of HCP who are appropriately prioritized for PPE and COVID-19 vaccination given their critical role in pandemic response. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [The results of this study in no way minimize the daily risk HCP take while attending to patients or working in clinics and hospitals, but rather emphasize the need to take greater precautions in the community -- for example, continuing physical distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing -- even after being vaccinated. This is true not only for HCP but also for members of the community. The study also points to how important it is that HCP are prioritized for PPE (personal protective equipment) and vaccination, on which they are dependent to be safe while they do their work. While there remains a large population of susceptible individuals, the virus will continue to circulate and present a serious public health risk. As more people are immunized, the risk should diminish but likely will not disappear. - Mod.LK] ****** [2] Children: mental health Date: Fri 12 Mar 2021 Source: AP News [edited] https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-mental-health-epidemics-coronavirus-pandemic-paris-8392ceff77ac8e1e0f90a32214e7def1 By the time his parents rushed him to the hospital, 11 year old [P] was barely eating and had stopped drinking entirely. Weakened by months of self-privation, his heart had slowed to a crawl and his kidneys were faltering. Medics injected him with fluids and fed him through a tube -- 1st steps toward stitching together yet another child coming apart amid the tumult of the coronavirus crisis. For doctors who treat them, the pandemic's impact on the mental health of children is increasingly alarming. The Paris pediatric hospital caring for [P] has seen a doubling in the number of children and young teenagers requiring treatment after attempted suicides since September [2020]. Doctors elsewhere report similar surges, with children -- some as young as 8 -- deliberately running into traffic, overdosing on pills and otherwise self-harming. In Japan, child and adolescent suicides hit record levels in 2020, according to the education ministry. Pediatric psychiatrists say they're also seeing children with coronavirus-related phobias, tics and eating disorders, obsessing about infection, scrubbing their hands raw, covering their bodies with disinfectant gel and terrified of getting sick from food. Also increasingly common, doctors say, are children suffering panic attacks, heart palpitations and other symptoms of mental anguish, as well as chronic addictions to mobile devices and computer screens that have become their sitters, teachers and entertainers during lockdowns, curfews and school closures. "There is no prototype for the child experiencing difficulties," said Dr Richard Delorme, who heads the psychiatric unit treating [P] at the giant Robert Debre pediatric hospital, the busiest in France. "This concerns all of us." Dr David Greenhorn said the emergency department at the Bradford Royal Infirmary where he works in northern England used to treat 1 or 2 children per week for mental health emergencies, including suicide attempts. The average now is closer to 1 or 2 per day, sometimes involving children as young as 8, he said. "This is an international epidemic, and we are not recognizing it," Greenhorn said in a telephone interview. "In an 8 year old's life, a year is a really, really, really long time. They are fed up. They can't see an end to it." At Robert Debre, the psychiatric unit typically used to see about 20 attempted suicide cases per month involving children aged 15 and under. Not only has that number now doubled in some months since September [2020], but some children also seem ever-more determined to end their lives, Delorme said. "We are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old," he said. "We sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it's not simply a provocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives. The levels of stress among children are truly massive," he said. "The crisis affects all of us, from age 2 to 99." [byline: John Leicester] -- communicated by: ProMED rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka [The stress adults feel from fear of COVID-19, fear over looming loss of a job, economic uncertainties, and so much more also likely is picked up by their children who are at home with them all day. As the report stated, "the crisis affects all of us, from age 2 to 99." But children have fewer coping mechanisms and cannot put into words the stress they are feeling or even identify what they are feeling. In many cases, the grief they are experiencing following loss of beloved family members weighs heavily on the household. The importance of attention not only to the physical health of the family but also to their mental health cannot be overstated. - Mod.LK] ****** [3] From our regional networks: Africa [A] COVID-19 update (33): Nigeria, vaccination   20210310.8236648 Date: Mon 8 Mar 2021 Source: Premium Times [abridged, edited] https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/447691-nigeria-distributes-covid-19-vaccines-to-states.html The Nigerian government on Monday [8 Mar 2021] said it has started distributing the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines to various states across the country. The executive director of National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, made this known at the weekly briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. He said adequate provision had been made to deploy the vaccines to all states and vaccination sites where people would be vaccinated according to set priorities, beginning with the health workers and other support staff. "All things being equal, the delivery of the vaccines will be completed tomorrow [9 Mar 2021]," Mr Shuaib said. He explained that the delivery of the vaccines to the states is predicated on satisfactorily meeting the conditions to keep them safe and potent. "We are designating vaccine accountability officers in the states and LGAs [local government areas] to closely monitor the management and utilization of the vaccines." Mr Shuaib said the state launch of the COVID-19 vaccination for health workers is slated for 9 Mar 2021 at the state treatment centers, barring any prevailing local conditions. "Most governors have agreed to flag off on [10 Mar 2021] while the statewide rollout of COVID-19 vaccine will commence from [12 Mar 2021]," he said.

The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are receiving their 1st doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against the coronavirus. There are 40 vaccination centres countrywide. Health authorities have launched a website where beneficiaries can sign up to get jabbed. So far, over 150 000 people have filled the online request. "They should sign an approval consent letter (before getting vaccinated), then we measure the pressure, and sugar level in the blood, and review all medical reports related to the person, then a doctor explains what the vaccine is and how to get it. We also mention that the person should have the 2nd dose after 3 months, as we give people the AstraZeneca vaccine," said Dr Eman Mohamed, head of New Nozha Hospital in Cairo. The north African nation began rolling out its anti-COVID-19 vaccination program in January [2021]. Shots were first given to frontline health care workers. -- communicated by: ProMED-EAFR <promed-eafr@promedmail.org> [The case count for COVID-19 in Africa continues to rise very sharply and is now at 3 964 055 with over 105 700 deaths as of 8 Mar 2021. Several African countries have had the privileged to roll out vaccination campaigns for their citizens. Whilst some countries have benefited from the COVAX scheme, others have had the chance to procure their own vaccine. The COVAX scheme is a vaccine-sharing initiative from the WHO to help poor countries obtain their own vaccine with help from rich countries. Egypt started vaccination of its citizens in January 2021 that targeted frontline health care workers and essential workers. Now they are in the 2nd phase to vaccinate elderly people and others most at risk.

With confirmed cases passing the 4-million mark, vaccination on the continent gathers pace. China, among the leading countries, has provided a significant amount of doses to African countries in their quest to conquer the virus. [Note that Xinhuanet is a Chinese state-run news service. - Mod.MPP] As African countries are scrambling to acquire vaccines from manufacturers, many of them have received doses from China, Russia, and the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines across the world. A total of 28 African nations have received the COVID-19 vaccines, 19 through the COVAX facility, 9 through bilateral agreements, and 16 of them have started vaccinating priority populations, according to a statement issued by Africa CDC on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said 24 African countries are expected to receive their doses procured under COVAX in March [2021]. She also said that 600 million doses procured under the COVAX facility will be delivered to Africa in 2021. Priority in vaccination is being given to medical front-liners, patients suffering from chronic diseases and the elderly. African leaders have also been at the forefront in receiving jabs, in an effort to boost public confidence in the doses. "The arrival of the 1st batch of vaccines through the COVAX facility, in which China also participates, is a welcomed development," said Olu Bolarinwa, lead pharmacist at the Safeway Medical Center based in Lagos, Nigeria "We have less than 4 million doses, but this is a drop in the ocean in view of our population. However, it is a welcomed development," said Bolarinwa. As countries on the continent step up procurement of vaccines, they also face challenges of the shortage of doses and inadequate health infrastructure. John Nkengasong, director of Africa CDC, believes that Africa faces several challenges in its vaccine rollout, the major one being timely access to the vaccines. "The 1st is how we timely access vaccines so that we can block the spread of this pandemic. Our number 2 challenge is that our populations have begun to face what is called pandemic fatigue. We have been doing this for one year and people are getting tired," he said. "Very few African countries have so far already ordered vaccines because we can't produce them locally," said Cavince Adhere, an international relations researcher in Kenya. WHO has observed that a successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccine in Africa largely depends on improving the knowledge of the continent's frontline health care workers in critical areas such as storage, supply chain management, and effective communication to the public. Ambrose Talisuna, emergency preparedness program manager at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, noted that a critical mass of trained health care workers is key to boosting COVID-19 vaccine preparedness and uptake in the continent. China has started to provide COVID-19 vaccines to 35 African countries and the African Union Commission and has provided close to 120 batches of emergency supplies to Africa and sent medical expert teams to 15 African countries to support their fight against the pandemic, he said. Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone were the first 3 African countries to get donations of Sinopharm doses last month [February 2021]. The donation to Equatorial Guinea on 10 Feb 2021 was the 1st batch of vaccine aid provided by the Chinese government to African countries. As of Monday [8 Mar 2021], 35 761 frontline workers in Zimbabwe had received the Sinopharm vaccine, according to the health ministry. -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [The rollout of vaccines is reaching Africa. The source URL of the above report has a map of Africa. An article from The New York Times mentions that the USA is partnering with Japan, India, and Australia to provide "financial support to help Biological E, a major vaccine manufacturer in India, produce at least one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2022", aimed at helping countries with difficulty securing vaccines ( https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/us/politics/biden-vaccine-diplomacy.html ). There's also pressure for local production in countries in Africa ( https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/africa/african-cdc-seeks-continental-capacity-to-produce-its-own-coronavirus-vaccines.html ). "African CDC director Dr John Nkengasong said that at least 5 African countries, including South Africa, Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, appear to have the capacity to produce vaccines." It is hoped these agreements will come to fruition and these countries will have vaccine security. - Mod.MPP] ****** [4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 12 Mar 2021) Date: Fri 12 Mar 2021 Source: WHO [abridged, edited] https://covid19.who.int/table *Daily case reports as of 12 Mar 2021 15:54 CET Surveillance ------------ WHO region (no. countries/territories): Total confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Western Pacific Region (19): 1 694 716 (7465) / 30 076 (133) European Region (61): 40 640 050 (199 249) / 900 997 (3259) South East Asia Region (10): 13 819 871 (31 159) / 211 740 (257) Eastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 793 641 (37 052) / 149 400 (442) Region of the Americas (54): 52 386 995 (184 077) / 1 258 134 (5207) African Region (49): 2 932 557 (8360) / 74 317 (174) Cases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0) Confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours) Grand total: 118 268 575 (467 362) / 2 624 677 (9472) -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [Data by country, area, or territory for 12 Mar 2021 can be accessed at  https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20update%2011%20Mar%202021_1615493681.pdf . - The Americas region reported 39.4% of daily case numbers and 55.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 52.38 million cases.

Officially reported WPV1 and cVDPV cases as of 9 Mar 2021: Wild poliovirus (WPV) - Total global WPV1 cases in 2021: 2 (compared with 23 for the same period in 2020) - Total global WPV1 cases in 2020: 140 Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases - Total global cVDPV cases in 2021: 26 (compared with 24 for the same period in 2020) - Total global cVDPV cases in 2020: 1084 -- communicated by: ProMED <promed@promedmail.org> [While there have been only 2 confirmed cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in 2021, the continued detection of positive environmental samples in Pakistan signal that the virus is circulating there. It appears as though the challenges of the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continue into 2021. Right now, there have been 2 cases attributable to WPV1 and 26 cases attributable to cVDPV2. At the risk of being a broken record, perhaps the time has come to seriously consider IPV.
