## Project Overview üçü <a name="projoverview"></a>
Ever since COVID-19's breakout, more awareness and emphasis has been placed on the effectiveness of communication and knowledge of disease and outbreaks. The **McNuggets** aim to to develop a platform that would contribute to an alert society with complete access to vital health information. This platform will automate the extraction of data from available sources in order to produce the following information for the public:
* Outbreak alerts: Important notifications regarding outbreaks of a new disease, existing disease in a new area, etc.
* Watching briefs: Analysis on serious outbreaks, involving origins, symptoms, treatments, fatality rate, etc.
* Digest: Newsletters available to inform policy makers, government and other stakeholders about outbreaks.

## Deliverable 1 üçü <a name="deliverable1"></a>
### Design Details <a name="designdetails"></a>
The overall development stack has been decided, but is flexible and subject to change. After collating a list of languages everyone is familiar with, we have decided to use Python for our API. This will most likely be used in conjunction with json and flask libraries. The operating system of choice for development and deployment will be Linux. We have also created a plan of action on how we are to develop the API module, which involves the scope of the API, identifying all endpoints, schema for parameters and responses, and more. Additionally, we have discussed the passing of parameters to the module and how the results should be collected. All of the above can be found more depth in our [Design Details Report](https://github.com/KennethMejico/SENG3011_McNuggets/blob/main/Reports/Design%20Details.md).

### Management Information <a name="maninfo"></a>
During deliverable 1, the **McNuggets** have assigned proper meeting times for standups, peer programming, admin work, etc. These meeting times will mainly take place on Tuesdays 13:00 - 14:20, and Sundays 21:00 - 22:00.
Team member responsibilities for Stage 1 (API Development, Webscraping, Documentation) were assigned, along with work arrangements for the first deliverable (Reports, GitHub repository). 

Our main software tools currently in use to assist project management are:
* Messenger Group Chat
* Microsoft Teams
* Github
* Stoplight
* Virtual Environments
* Google Docs
* Selenium / Requests
