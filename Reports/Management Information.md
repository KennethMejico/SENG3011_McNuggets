## Deliverable 1 üçü <a name="deliverable1"></a>
For deliverable 1, we had initially sorted out meeting times that we could use for peer programming, standups, admin work, questions, and other miscellaneous enquiries. These meeting times are as follows (flexible and are subject to change):
* Tuesday 13:00 - 14:20
* Sunday 21:00 - 22:00

Preferences for roles were resolved, with everyone being assigned a particular task for **Stage 1**.

### Team Coordination: <a name="teamcoord"></a>
Main tools that we use for communication and contact are:
* Messenger Group Chat
* Microsoft Teams

Other software tools that we use or may use for project management:
* Google Suite
  * Google Docs
* GitHub
* Stoplight
* Virtual Environments

### Meeting Logs: <a name="mlogs"></a>
For our own convenience, we have created team meeting logs that can be found [here.](https://github.com/KennethMejico/SENG3011_McNuggets/blob/main/Reports/Meeting%20Logs.md)

### Project Planning: <a name="projplan"></a>
In order to stay organised, we have created a gantt chart that roughly outlines important deadlines and our time management plan for each deliverable:

## Deliverable 2 üçü <a name="deliverable2"></a>
### Management Issues: <a name="maniss"></a>
During the middle of deliverable 2, one of our members, Vicknesh, had chosen to drop the course and was initially part of API development. As a result, Kenneth had taken his place, and the entire workload of the project felt much heavier without an integral member. The deadline extension did help in alleviating this pressure, but the project would have definitely benefitted with Vicknesh's presence.

## Deliverable 4 üçü <a name="deliverable4"></a>
### Team Organisation <a name="teamorg"></a>
Our team communicated on an informal basis using a Messenger group chat. More formally, we strove to meet at least once a week, often twice, in a voice chat on Microsoft Teams. The same Teams room was used for communication with our mentor. These meetings were used to discuss progress, highlight problems and plan out the next week. Closer to presentations they were also used to rehearse and go over app features to make sure they were working as intended. A Google Doc was also used to collaborate on the writing of each report, and other google products were used for collaborative work on other deliverables.

The responsibilities of each team member is described by the following table. Bear in mind that there is naturally some amount of crossover in tasks and that the tasks listed are not an exhaustive list.
| Team Member | James | Kenneth | Liam | Luke |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Backend Scraper, Scraper Testing, Report Generation, Database Initialization, Database Updating | API Development, API Documentation, Report Documentation/Submissions | API Documentation, API Deployment, Testing | API Development, API Documentation, Database schema |
| Phase 2 | Backend (Mail, Geolocater, Map), Frontend (Map, Find my location) | Frontend Design (Figma), Backend Scraper (covidlive), Alert System | Frontend design, App Navigation, Bugfixing, Testing | Search endpoint, Results - Graph, Table |

### Appraisal of Work <a name="appraisal"></a>
#### James
Generally speaking, I believe this project went well. Considering time restraints, limits on project and a variety of interrupting factors I ultimately believe that what we achieved was quite good. 

One of the major achievements I am quite proud of is how we worked through and all managed to communicate during the project. In terms of the project itself, I was very happy with our API. A variety of endpoints and strong documentation made our one quite good, and the fact that the updating function I wrote actually worked was quite incredible in my opinion (I seriously didn‚Äôt think it would).

Unfortunately, we had a variety of factors that caused interruptions to our project and problems related to them, such as a team member suddenly leaving and the CSE data loss. The former caused a large required increase in workload from the rest of the team, and the latter caused losses of work and increased stress before the final deliverable was due. Despite these setbacks among many other different setbacks, we managed to work through them and still deliver a product I believe we should be proud of. 

Before the workshop I wish I had more emphasis placed on the product we would be delivering. Whilst I understand part of this project is doing research outside of your area of expertise and comfort, it means any ideas we have to develop for the final product are all going to be surface level ideas that don‚Äôt actually target the fundamentals of the issues we are developing around.

The main thing I would do differently about this project now is our final deliverable. We tried doing too many things at the same time without focusing on one major aspect of it and developing that. I believe that this was a mistake, as it meant our final product wasn‚Äôt very focused like it could have been.

It‚Äôs been a pleasure working with Liam, Kenneth and Luke. They‚Äôve all been great teammates and I was very happy to have been able to do this project with them.

#### Kenneth
It was quite an interesting project that had encouraged all of us to work on unfamiliar things, overall being a great learning experience on the inner workings of software development, both on the backend and frontend side of things. It definitely could have been executed a lot better had there been less unexpected interactions and disruptions, but I am content with the work we were able to produce as a team and hope to use what I‚Äôve learnt during the course much further.

In terms of personal major achievements, I was able to work on different implementations which I was initially unfamiliar with, such as web scraping, API development, API documentation, and frontend development. Being exposed to these allows me to gain a greater understanding of software development for web apps as a whole.
Throughout the course, there were many setbacks and issues which were unexpected, but were still things to be preemptively considered and prepared for. An integral member, Vicknesh, had left the group during the middle of stage 1, which obviously affected the overall performance of our group as we all had to put in more work with the original time constraints. The course didn‚Äôt have a firm structure, not being prepared for flex week and pushing back important dates. This meant that there was a deliverable due during flex week, as well as stage 2 having a shorter time frame as stage 1 was extended. Our team also wasn‚Äôt experienced in frontend design, although this project was a good opportunity to learn it, I believe our design could‚Äôve been more polished and refined had there been extra time.

Prior to the workshop, I do wish to have had more experience in both API implementation and frontend design, as our API wasn‚Äôt the best and definitely had some performance issues. In regards to what I would do differently, I would have liked to have received a better idea of what past groups and projects have done in the past. I would have also approached the specifications a bit differently and collate proper questioning in order to achieve greater clarity for the project.

#### Liam
I can not honestly say that this project went well; there were far too many issues, complications and just general bad luck plaguing all eight odd weeks. Some of the unfortunate events:
- Our fifth team member dropped the course without warning in the middle of developing the API, without having done any part of the work assigned to him. This later reduced the amount of time our group as a whole was able to put into each deliverable, and forced us to lower our expectations of the end product.
- Our plan to host the API on Amazon‚Äôs Elastic Beanstalk failed due to poor documentation and difficult to solve bugs.
- The subsequent switch to AWS Lambda meant that using the framework we had used for our backend (Flask) was impractical to use for hosting.
- Promed was a difficult site to scrape data from.
- Populating the database with all the data on Promed took far too long and would have required running our script for several days.
- Returning results from our database (and in turn our API) took longer than was reasonable.
- Dealing with all these bugs gave us less time to work on peripherals - tests, documentation, reports - and these areas were not fully developed to our liking.
- It turned out that none of our group had any particular familiarity with frontend design and construction, and there was no one framework that everyone had used before.
- When considering an API to use from ours or other teams, we were unable to find one that worked especially well for our purposes. Our original consideration was SourDough, but we found that their data was not especially complete.
- The loss of CSE data that apparently afflicted 1% of the CSE population hit two out of four people in our group. While I fortunately wasn‚Äôt one of them, this did slow the team down as a whole.
- Due to time limitations areas of our app weren‚Äôt able to be fully developed, in particular our map and email alerts.

With all that said, despite this course being the roughest project I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune to do, our team worked very well together and were able to manage most of these issues. Our API was buggy, slow, and incomplete, but it did work to some degree. Our application built for the most recent deliverable was also incomplete compared to our hopes for it, but aside from the map and alert notifications, everything was there, working and as comprehensive as we could make it with our limited data source. I‚Äôm actually quite happy with the frontend design - I‚Äôve seen snappier but it doesn‚Äôt look half bad. We also did quite well at managing new data sources and frameworks: between Google Maps and Geocoding APIs, Nivo line charts, scraping covid-live as an additional data source and setting up react-router we each had to manage something strange and alien, and in all cases we were successful in learning these new systems.

In terms of skills to have before the workshop, I would most definitely say front end design, which has not been formally covered in any of the courses I‚Äôve done to this point (though it‚Äôs been necessary to have for other courses: e.g. SENG2021. In terms of things to do differently, obviously all the previously described issues could have been avoided with foresight, but one big regret I have was the decision to try and use Elastic Beanstalk. Going with Lambda immediately would have added so much more time to use on developing tests and a better API.

This term has been rough, but as mentioned the team was not a problem. This group has been a pleasure to work with, and I believe that we worked together to overcome these problems as well as we were able to.

#### Luke
Overall, I believe the project went well in that we were able to develop a working API (with limitations) and a working web app that is able to display search results in various forms as well as display alerts for potential lockdowns which was what we set out to do. Of course, there are many ways we could have improved upon our deliverables, however, given the time frame of the project and the fact that our team was short on one member, I‚Äôm happy with what we were able to achieve.

Personally, some major achievements for me was being able to come up with a database schema and then develop a searching algorithm to filter through that data for our API. Although the algorithm‚Äôs performance could be improved, I‚Äôm still proud of the fact that it worked in providing the intended functionality. Some other achievements I am proud of include being able to make a working Graph and Table that is able to display our search results which was a large part of our web app.

The issues and problems I encountered were mainly to do with how to develop or implement a specific feature. With the course not providing much guidance in terms of how to develop certain features, a lot of time was spent on researching or trying out different ways of implementing a certain feature.

The skills I wish I had before starting the workshop include knowing how to use React, knowing how to deploy an API with a database, and other technical skills. However, I realise that with projects, a lot of time will likely be spent researching and developing these types of skills. Nevertheless, more detailed or specific deliverable specs would have helped in giving us more direction in what needed to be done.
